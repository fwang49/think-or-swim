Coppock Curve is a momentum indicator designed for long term trend trading. You can check out the original indicator for ThinkorSwim here. By default, it will show buy signals on the weekly charts and nothing else.

You won't be able to view it when switching to shorter timeframes like the daily, hourly, or 15 mins. The Coppock Curve indicator was made to pick trending stocks. Therefore, it will not generate any sell (short) signals.

Since it did so well on the weekly chart, I decided to modify the Coppock indicator a bit to work on shorter timeframes. And to my surprise, I found a lot of nice signals during backtesting.

Here's what included in the package:

Coppock Curve strategy for short term trading
Sell Signals (As originally stated, Coppock will look for trending stocks so it doesn't produce sell signals by default. I had to reverse some of the code for it to do so)
4 EMA / 9 SMA crossover for profit taking and stop loss
13 EMA for additional support with profit taking and minimizing losses if a trade goes wrong.

Attached below is 2 different source code. One for long strategy and other is for short strategy. I have 2 grids available on my screen so it's easier for me to view and identify which signal is which. You're more than welcome to combine into one screen. And don't forget those codes need to be added as a New Strategy, NOT indicator.

About Profit Taking and Cutting Losses
The Coppock Curve will only generate buy (long) and sell (short) signals. Your job is to take profit when available. I added the 4 EMA and 9 SMA crossover for profit taking and also the 13 EMA.

The buy (long) and sell (short) signals will be generated by the Coppock Curve indicator. As far as knowing when to take profit or cut losses, I added the 4 EMA and 9 SMA crossover for that purpose. If you have a medium to high-risk tolerance, you can wait for the EMA to fire a signal to let you know its time to take profit or cut losses.

If your risk tolerance isn't that high but you still want to maximize your profit, you can use the 13 EMA that I included instead of waiting for the crossover. Ride it until it closed above/below the opposite direction.

Notes:

Use the 15min
Avoid trading ETFs such as SPY, IWM, XLF, etc although ETFs can have its good days as well. But generally I would stick to individual stocks for this strategy.
