this is an enhanced version of the Hahn.. It's all spikes in one.
I put it on my ttm panel, with fast stoch..
you'll get an orange, green and red spike.
or make them whatever color you want.
i also have it in my watchlist for red, orange and green.
and alerts to my phone
and i only get alerts for the stocks in my watchlist.
it took me for freaking EVER to figure it out.
in the marketwatch .. Scan In -
choose your watchlist.. So i get it for only 45 stocks.. the ones I covet.. lol
in the scan.. when you're setting it up.. scan tab
at the top..
Scan In :
but when you're setting it up.. it obviously starts w creating the scan, then the  'alerts when ...."   it will create it automatically in the Marketwatch tab.
I learned the last part from Hahn.   But the other part was literally days saying to myself there has to be a way to only scan in my list.  i called TOS numerous times.. they said you can't do it. blah blah.. very helpful nice ppl - don't get me wrong, but there is soooo much on that platform
