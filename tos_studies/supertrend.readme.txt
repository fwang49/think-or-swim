Supertrend Indicator: shows trend direction and gives buy or sell signals according to that. It is based on a combination of the average price rate in the current period along with a volatility indicator. The ATR indicator is most commonly used as volatility indicator. The values are calculated as follows:

Up = (HIGH + LOW) / 2 + Multiplier * ATR 
Down = (HIGH + LOW) / 2 â€“ Multiplier * ATR 
When the change of trend occurs, the indicator flips
